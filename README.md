# Grocery-Line-Simulation

The grocery store will have multiple lines and customers would like to choose the shortest line
(based on the number of items that need to be checked out). Every minute ("step") the clerk at the front of each line will "process" one item from the front customer. When a customer has no more items to process, they will leave the line. Every so often, another customer will get into line, picking the line
with the least number of items to checkout remaining.
